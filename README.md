##  Getting and Cleaning Data Course Coursera Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. To accomplish the assignment it was required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

## Source raw data

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## run_analysis.R
It is requested to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The run_analysis.R script does the requested operations taking in input the raw data and outputting a file named tidy.txt whose codebook is described in the CodeBook.md file.

Download of the original file instructions were omitted from the script.
